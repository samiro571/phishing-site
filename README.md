# phishing-site paperwork

In this assignment, the login screen of the social media giant Facebook, now Meta, is to be faked. First, this example requires downloading Visual Studio Code and installing PHP. Then, all that needs to be done is to create two files that will be tested in the localhost. An HTML file that contains the web page text and codes that define the output of the text in the browser. Simply put, this file defines how the user will perceive the web page. The second file contains a post method that defines what should happen once the potential victim has fallen for the phishing website.
